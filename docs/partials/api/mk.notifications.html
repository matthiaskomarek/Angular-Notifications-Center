<p>The mk.notifications module provides a service to display notification messages in front of the user.
Notifications are placed on the top right corner of the screen and are visible for 90s.
Notifications are also dismissable by close button
Notifications get stacked up until the max amount is reached (Default: 5). The service will group older notifications
into a group so that the max amount is satisfied again.
If a visible notification gets dismissed, the newest grouped notification gets visible again.</p>
